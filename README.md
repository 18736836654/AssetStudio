# AssetStudio-blk
Check out the [original AssetStudio project](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio) for more information.

There's already another AssetStudio fork that can load Genshin Impact serialized files, but I didn't make it and therefore didn't want to distribute it without permission.

This one is a fork that I've written myself from scratch. Unlike the other fork(s), this one can load .blk files directly and properly load Texture2Ds.

See [genshinblkstuff](https://github.com/khang06/genshinblkstuff) for more information about .blk decryption and extraction.
